## Walkthrough Video
    
Here is a link to the walkthrough videos: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MsLTJ__UaxeDUABHFGGcm9LSRzjaOebV/view

First video shows the db being created in mysql shell, seeding the db and starting the server.

Second video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACI9tJKYeakWfAzN9OoRA39mTPt41VMT/view

shows functionality of each get, post, put and delete request through insomnia

I have an error shown near the end of the second video that I was unable to debug, but the main functionality is there.
